              <p>Both sides of Kirk's family tree migrated from Jamaica to America in the early 1970s. Kirk was born in Jamaica however he moved to the United States at the age of four months old. A majority of Kirk's family now reside in America but they still carry the strong roots of their upbringing in Jamaica deep in their hearts. The Jamaican national motto is 'Out of Many One People', based on the population's multiracial roots. Kirk and his family truly believe this motto, they all carry the humanitarian spirit to help others regardless of race, class, or creed.<br>
